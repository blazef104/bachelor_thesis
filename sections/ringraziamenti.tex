\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my family for everything they have done for me, especially my mother and my father and Sarah for always being there.

\bigskip
\noindent I would like to thank Andrei Costin for all the help and support he gave me during this research, for the high standards of his teachings and last but not least for his friendship. I am proud of calling him a friend more than a teacher.

\bigskip
\noindent My gratitude also goes to Valerio Bellandi for his valuable suggestions, and to my flatmate Cem that made my staying in Finland easier, happier and funnier.

\bigskip
\noindent I would also like to thank all my friends and the people I met during the Erasmus period who made me feel at home.

\bigskip
\noindent To conclude I would like to thank all my friends that always supported me and believed in me: Francesco, Giorgio, Emanuele, Michele, Sergio, Giulia, Costanza, Pietro, Davide and all the others that have always been there for me.
