\chapter{Fuzzing}
\section{Brief History}

The term Fuzz Testing was first introduced in 1988 when three students from University of Wisconsin-Madison
proposed a tool to test the behavior of UNIX Utilities when given unexpected random characters as input. \cite{firstFuzzPaper}
Those first tools where pretty simple and as it can be easily imagined they just generated random strings.
However the findings where impressive: 25-30\% of the tested utilities crashed when tested with the new tools.
For this reason fuzz testing begin to gain more and more popularity until the first years of 2000 when it grow at the point
that it become a filed of research and engineering.

This initial fuzzing technique is known as \texttt{Black Box Fuzzing}.

Getting closer to the present day more and more techniques for fuzz testing emerged, I will illustrate some of those in the following
sections:

\section{White Box Fuzzing}
This is a more sophisticated fuzzing technique, compared to the \texttt{Black Box Fuzzing}
