\chapter{Analysis}
\label{chap:experimsetup}

Accessing real avionics hardware and software was out of reach for this research, therefore the analysis was carried out on open source implementations of \textbf{ADS-B}, \textbf{FIS-B} and \textbf{NexRad} as found in many popular source-tree, binary-package and device-firmware releases such as Stratux, FlightRadar24 and FlightAware. Testing on those software has also secondary relevant implications as it allows to test at the same time avionics protocols as well as IoT devices. As a matter of fact, even though avionics software must comply with strict regulations and security standards as described in DO-178 (ED-12 in europe) and DO-278, it is highly likely that using one of the previously mentioned protocols as attack vector will have the same effect on both implementations.

Fuzzing was choosen as test method since, as far as it was known at the beginning of the research, no previous attempt of applying this test method to avionics protocols had been carried out. This research acquire even more importance if we examine the latest news about the hacking of a Boeing 757 and the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) 2016~\cite{CGC}. In particular, the CGC contained a specific challenge (\texttt{FSK\_Messaging\_Service})~\cite{CGC-FSK} tailored to identify techniques and systems able to discover vulnerabilities in the RF software using processed data after the RF front-ends. Aircraft and avionics radio-communication interfaces are a perfect example of that type of design.
\textit{afl-unicron} has been demonstrated to be particularly effective on solving this specific challenge of the CGC.

There is no official linking between the CGC and the Boeing hack however, the circumstances indicate that there is a search and a need for knowledge and tools that can exploit (and therefore eventually protect) RF facing software, embedded devices in general and avionics and NextGen devices in particular.

\section{Hardware Setup}

The hardware used during the research was the following:
\begin{itemize}

\item \textit{DVB-T (RTL-SDR) dongle:} a simple and cheap tv receiver equipped with the \emph{RTL2832U} or compatible chip it can be tuned on a very wide range of frequencies, not only on the tv ones.

\item \textit{RaspberryPi (RPi) 3 Model B:} used to acquire the data using RTL-SDR dongles, and also to run some tests on the precompiled binaries. The RPi was running the latest version of Raspbian, or the particular flavor/version of Linux or Raspbian bundled as part of Stratux and FlightRadar24 SD-card firmware image files.

\item \textit{Standard laptop:} used for dry-run testing, for initial code testing and for initial fuzzing experiments monitoring. The laptop has the following specifications: Intel Core i7 5500 (4 cores), 12 GB of RAM. Since the fuzzing is time and resource consuming, when the running experiments were considered promising or really important, they were moved to run on a multi-core server.

\item \textit{Multi-core server:} with following specifications: Intel Xeon CPU E7-8837 @ 2.67GHz (64 cores, 32 cores used for a single given afl-fuzz instance), 1 TB of RAM, running Centos7.4 Linux.
\end{itemize}

\todo{why}

\section{Software Setup}

\todo{Explain why we used what we used.}

The focus was posed on two of the most widespread and common implementations: \emph{dump1090} and \emph{dump978} obviously the first one decode \textbf{OldGen} and \textbf{1090ES} messages while the second one decode \textbf{UAT} messages. Both of them uses \emph{librtlsdr} to communicate with the rtl-sdr dongle

Tested software have two main components:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A \emph{demodulator} that converts the raw signal coming from the dongle into a properly encoded string. This basically means converting waves into bits.
  \item A \emph{decoder} that decodes the messages coming from the demodulator. Basically extracting the information from the incoming packet.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{dump1090} is a big monolithic software which has undergone major reworks and edits from many different authors. For this reason it is not possible to test individually each components.

\subsection{Datasets}

In order to test the above mentioned programs some data were needed.

\subsection{Tools}
\label{sec:tools}

During the project I wrote a set of tools and scripts that played a major role
in automating and simplifying some of the data processing and fuzzing tasks.
Such tools are divided in two categories: \textbf{Data Tools} used to manage,
modify and create the datasets. \textbf{Fuzzing Tools} used to facilitate and
speed up the fuzzing process. The details and descriptions of the tools are as
follows.
\bigskip

\textbf{Data Tools:}

\begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{converter.sh} and \textbf{runner.sh} this scripts are meant to
  interact with the data provided by the DO-358 zip file.This archive contains
  different files which are designed to be used with a dedicated test tool for
  real  avionics hardware, for  this reason there are 18 subfolders (called
  groups)  and for each one of them  there are 3 files: \texttt{TestGroupXX
  Procedures.doc}, \texttt{TestGroupXX  Stimulus.csv} and a \texttt{bin} folder
  containing the actual data files.  Each one of this folders contain many
  different files,  each representing a unique type of  information which has
  already been  demodulated and is stored in a binary  format. Since the program
  that we want  to test only accepts data in a  uplink(or downlink) format we
  wrote  \textbf{converter.sh} to convert one  single file or an entire
  directory in  the appropriate format. Every file  contains just one encoded
  type of data and  with many files feeding them into a  program will be long
  and tedious. The  \textbf{runner.sh} script will feed each  file contained
  inside a specified  directory through the specified program  either
  interactively, namely stopping  after each file and asking if the user  wants
  to continue, or simply running  all files at one.

  %   \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/converterrunner.png}
  %   \caption{converter.sh and runner.sh}
  %   \label{fig:datatools1}
  % \end{figure}

  \item \textbf{message\_generator.py} is a simple script that given the first
  part of a demodulated Mode-S message will calculate a correct CRC, it can do
  this virtually for every random string with a correct length. This is only for
  test purpose since we wanted to see what would happen when the test program is
  fed with messages composed by all 1 or all 0 having a valid CRC.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Fuzzing Tools:}

\begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{start.sh}: afl can be parallelized on many cores, to do that a
  different command with slightly different parameters must be issued for every
  instance that you want to spawn. For this reason I wrote \textbf{start.sh}
  which takes as input the number of cores that the  user wants to use and the
  other parameters required by the fuzzer. The script  will then generate the
  required directories and then start the chosen number  of fuzzers: 1 Master
  and $n-1$ Slave.

  \item \textbf{unicorn\_template\_generator.py}: \texttt{afl-unicorn} requires
  quite  some time to set up all the environment and gather all the information
  needed  to properly write the template for the Unicorn engine. For this reason
  we  wrote this script which will create the template for the Unicorn engine
  and  populate it with proper addresses. The script is designed to be sourced
  into  GDB while the debugger is on a breakpoint inside a function, it will not
  work  if called inside the main since what we want to test is usually a
  particular  function.

  \item \textbf{extract\_from\_memory.py} will dump the specified memory region from a running program in gdb so it can be used as input to \texttt{afl-unicorn}.  More information on how
  \texttt{afl-unicorn} works and why this scripts are needed can be found in \ref{sub:afl-unicorn}. %\textbf{\nameref{sub:afl-unicorn}}.

  \item \textbf{afl utility scripts}:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{killem\_afl.sh} $\rightarrow$ stop a running instance of afl.

    \item \textbf{wazzup\_afl.sh} $\rightarrow$  get information and statistics on the running instances of the specified fuzzer.

    \item \textbf{afl\_noroot.sh} $\rightarrow$ run afl on a system where the user does not have root privileges.

  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
